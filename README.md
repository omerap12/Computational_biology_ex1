# Computational Biology EX1

First assignment in the course Computational Biology at BIU.


## Usage/Examples
if you're using a version of Python that doesn't include tkinter or if you're using a virtual environment, you may need to install it using your system's package manager or via pip. In that case, you can use the following command to install tkinter:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
pip install tkinter
```
And then run
```python3
python3 main.py
```
